<p>Upside helps grow companies and careers by providing digital travel services and support to small-and-midsize companies. I have iterated on and added to Upside's responsive shopping flow since April 2017. I designed the current flow with a persistent shopping cart to accomodate more complex trips and show transparent pricing. When I joined, Upside was in beta and only sold flight and hotel packages to DIY travelers. Today, we sell flights, hotels, and rental cars in any trip combination, and offer a suite of corporate travel management tools. 
<br>
<br>
The designs are influenced by my user research--user interviews, usability testing, surveys, cart sorts, and A/B testing. From early discovery all the way to implementation, I design new features with sketches, user flows, rough wire frames to clarify product requirements, interactive prototypes to test with customers, and high-fidelity mockups for engineers to build.
<br>
<br>
I also established a shared language between designers and engineers around the Material Design system and React code framework for efficient product delivery.</p>
